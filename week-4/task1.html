    <h1>History of javascript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that was originally developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was at Netscape Communications. It was created in just ten days and initially named "Mocha," later becoming "LiveScript" and ultimately "JavaScript" as part of a marketing agreement with Sun Microsystems. JavaScript quickly became popular due to its ability to bring dynamic, interactive features to web pages, setting it apart from the static nature of HTML and CSS.

        <h2>Purpose of JavaScript</h2>
        
       <P> JavaScript was designed to make websites interactive and improve user experience on the client side (i.e., in the user's browser)</P>
       <h3> Its primary purposes include:</h3>
        
        <p>1. Interactivity: Allows dynamic content updates, animations, and user-driven changes without needing to reload the page.
        
        
        2. Event Handling: Handles user inputs like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs to enhance responsiveness.
        
        
        3. DOM Manipulation: Modifies the Document Object Model (DOM) in real-time, enabling dynamic page content and layout adjustments.
        
        
        4. Validation and Data Handling: Validates forms and processes data on the client side before sending it to the server, reducing server load and improving efficiency.</p>
        <h3> Where JavaScript Runs in the Web Environment</h3>
        
        <p>JavaScript initially ran only on the client side within web browsers, interpreted by the browser's JavaScript engine (such as V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, and JavaScriptCore in Safari). This client-side execution allows JavaScript to interact with the DOM and respond to user interactions without needing server communication.
        
        However, with the introduction of Node.js in 2009, JavaScript could also run on the server side. Node.js is a runtime that enables JavaScript to perform server-side tasks, making it possible to use JavaScript as a full-stack language for both client- and server-side development. This transformation broadened JavaScript's application from solely browser-based interactions to back-end operations, server applications, and even some desktop and mobile applications.</p>
